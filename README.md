# work-status-light

To reduce inturruptions & confusion when working from home, this program changes a desk light's color to either red or green to reflect work/meeting status. (red = busy, green = free)

To run `working_status.py`, enter the ip, username, & light_name for your light set-up in the `hue_certificates.py` file.
